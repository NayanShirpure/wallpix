    <h2><Lightbulb className="inline-block mr-2 h-6 w-6 text-accent" />Tips for Crafting Great Prompts</h2>
    <p>
      The quality and relevance of your generated wallpaper heavily depend on your prompt. Here are some tips:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 my-4">
      <li>
        <strong>Be Specific (But Not Too Restrictive):</strong> Instead of "a cat," try "a fluffy ginger cat napping in a sunbeam on a cozy blue rug."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Include Art Styles:</strong> Add terms like "oil painting," "watercolor," "pixel art," "cyberpunk," "impressionistic," "photorealistic," or "cartoon style."
        <div className="my-4 flex justify-center">
          <Image
            src="https://placehold.co/700x350.png"
            alt="Examples of different art styles: oil painting vs pixel art"
            width={700}
            height={350}
            className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
            data-ai-hint="art styles comparison"
          />
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mood and Atmosphere:</strong> Use words like "serene," "mystical," "energetic," "dark and moody," "bright and cheerful."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Color Palettes:</strong> Specify colors, e.g., "a landscape with cool blues and purples," or "a warm autumn scene with oranges and reds."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine Concepts:</strong> Don't be afraid to mix ideas, like "a futuristic city made of candy" or "a steampunk owl reading a book."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Iterate:</strong> If the first result isn't perfect, tweak your prompt and try again. Add more detail, remove some, or change the style.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Prompts:</h3>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-2">
        <li>"A tranquil Japanese zen garden with cherry blossoms, minimalist, soft morning light."</li>
        <li>"Cyberpunk cityscape at night, neon signs reflecting on wet streets, high detail."</li>
        <li>"Cosmic whale swimming through a nebula, vibrant purples and blues, fantasy art."</li>
        <li>"Abstract geometric patterns in gold and emerald green, art deco style."</li>
    </ul>
     <div className="my-6 flex justify-center">

    <h2><Edit3 className="inline-block mr-2 h-6 w-6 text-accent" />What to Expect (It's Experimental!)</h2>
    <p>
      Our AI Wallpaper Generator uses Google's Gemini model. While powerful, AI image generation is an evolving field.
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 my-2">
      <li><strong>Results May Vary:</strong> Sometimes the AI will nail your vision, other times it might be a bit quirky. That's part of the fun!</li>
      <li><strong>Wait Times:</strong> Image generation isn't instantaneous. Please be patient.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Policies:</strong> The AI adheres to Google's <a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-accent hover:underline" aria-label="Google's Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy (opens in new tab)">Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy</a>.
